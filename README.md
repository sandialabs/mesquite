Mesquite: Mesh Quality Improvement Toolkit

This was previously hosted on software.sandia.gov.
The pipermail support mailing list is archived but no longer active.
Besides the contents from software.sandia.gov, this has an additional readme, LICENSE, and manifest. 
There are two versions that were once hosted by the Trilinos repository.
Unfortunately there is no guidance about whether the two Trilinos versions differ in substance, nor which is more recent or more suitable for any particular use.

Software and documentation is under the "mesquite" folder.
