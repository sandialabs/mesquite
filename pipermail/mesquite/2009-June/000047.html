This happens because the boundary nodes are unconstrained.  You need to
constrain their position or the solver can move them anywhere.  There are
two ways this can be done:
  a) Tell Mesquite that they are fixed (by returning the appropriate fixed
     flag from your Mesh implementation, or if using MeshImpl, by using a
     scalar attribute in the VTK file to indicate which nodes are fixed.)
  b) Provide Mesquite with the geometric shape of the boundary (e.g. CAD
     data) and the list of which nodes are constrained to which portions
     of the boundary.  This is done by implementing a subclass of the
     Mesquite::MeshDomain class defined in include/MeshInterface.hpp.
