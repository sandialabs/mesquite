Mesquite uses objects to represent components of an optimizer.  Things such as:
  quality metric - evaluate the quality of the mesh at some local feature
                   (e.g. quality of an element)
  objective function - define some global scalar value to optimize for the
                       mesh (e.g. average of quality for each element)
  quality improver - improve mesh quality
  termination criterion - conditions upon which to terminate optimization
  solver - subset of quality improvers that work by minimizing an objective
           function
  quality assessor - print summary of one or more quality metrics evaluated
                     over the mesh
  instruction queue - group top-level operations (solver, quality assessor,
                      etc.) and provide API to initiate optimization
                      process.

There are many different implementations of each of these types or classes
of objects.  Instances of implementations are assembled to construct an
optimizer.  There's an example of this in section 3.1.4 of the manual.

Mesquite also provides two &quot;wrapper&quot; classes that take care of assembling an
optimizer for the two most common use cases.  These are
ShapeImprovementWrapper and LaplacianIQ.  This is discussed briefly in
section 3.1.3 of the manual.

Creating an optimizer or using one of the wrappers is fairly straightforward
given an minimal understanding of C++.  As you are not very familiar with
C++, I could probably put together a simple FORTRAN wrapper function for you
if you were to describe exactly what you want for an optimizer.

The more complex question is how to get your mesh data into Mesquite.  This
can be subdivided into two subsets: the mesh and the domain.  The mesh is
the node locations, element connectivity, and the set of vertices that are
fixed.  This is sufficient to set up an optimization when all the boundary
vertices are fixed.  The domain is the geometry that some subset of the
nodes are constrained to lie on, and the association of specific nodes with
specific subsets of the domain (e.g. with individual surfaces or curves of
intersection of those surfaces.)

The interface for accessing mesh in Mesquite is the Mesquite::Mesh class,
which groups a set of call-back functions for querying characteristics of
the mesh and modifying vertex coordinates (and a few other details.)  In the
most general case one would provide implementations of all the callbacks
that directly access some application data in a solver or mesh generation
package.  For simpler cases Mesquite 1.1 provides the MeshImpl class, which
is an implementation of the callbacks that access data stored in a VTK 3.0
file[1] (simple ASCII format for mesh.)  Mesquite 2.0 (will be released
today or tomorrow) will include the ArrayMesh class.  This class implements
callbacks that access data in arrays provided by the application (e.g. array
of vertex coordinates, array of vertex indices defining elements, etc.)
This class was added with the hope of simplifying this process for many
FORTRAN applications.  A third method of accessing mesh data is also
provided in Mesquite 2.0:  MsqIMesh.  This class acts as an adapter to
access mesh data through the iMesh[2] API.  These are discussed in chapter 4
of the manual.

The Mesquite::MeshDomain class defines the set of callbacks for accessing
the geometric domain for the mesh.  While Mesquite does provide a few
trivial implementations, these certainly will not be sufficient to represent
something like a portion of an aircraft.  So it will be necessary to
implement the callbacks for this, either by directly implementing those
defined in the MeshDomain class or by implementing the necessary subset of
the iGeom and iRel ITAPS interfaces[2] and using the MsqIGeom adapter.
