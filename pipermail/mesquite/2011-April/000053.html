Apologies for the tardy response.

As you observed, this metric will not work with QualityAssessor.  It will
also not work with block coordinate descent optimizations.  This is because
Mesquite mixes two distinct ideas in its concept of an element-based metric.
 The first is that the metric is evaluated once for each element, which is
okay.  The second, where things break, is that the metric value depends only
on the element.

There are several ways this could be addressed in Mesquite.  The most
obvious solution and the most work would be to eliminate that second
assumption.  This would involve giving all metrics a virtual function that
returned the number of layers of adjacent entities required to evaluate the
metric and updating QualityAssessor, BCD initialization, and possibly a few
other places such that they honor that value.

An alternate solution is to re-define the metric as a side-based metric (a
metric that is evaluated once per shared element side rather than once per
element).  But this would change the metric.  If the objective function
where the algebraic mean, then instead of:
  f = 1/n sum( max( R(e_i,e_j) )
with i being the element and j being each adjacent element, you'd instead have:
  f = 1/n sum( R(e_i-,e_i+) )
where i is the logical element side and e_i- and e_i+ are the two elements
that share that side.

The downside to the latter approach is that Mesquite doesn't have a concept
of a side-based metric (or more specifically for this metric an
interior/shared-side based metric.)  However, you could add such an metric
type without needing to modify other code in Mesquite.  Simply define the
type base class (e.g. InteriorSideQM).  You can model such an implementation
on the existing EdgeQM.  It should be simpler in some ways because you are
not interested in boundary sides (sides not shared by multiple elements.)
