I think so, but I had less grey hair then...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Time for me to chime in with an outside-mesquite answer for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for a different perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Steve, you can do what you want in several ways: 1) Feed the point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locations and element connectivity into mesquite directly, set the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surface points as being fixed, then smooth the interior (all this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a wrapper function you'd have to construct which would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callable from Fortran)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jason has been kind enough to send me this in C++. I'm now developing
</I>&gt;<i> a method of loading the input grid data and setting the initial grid
</I>&gt;<i> for MESQUITE to smooth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) implement your own version of mesquite's mesh access functions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which will pull the data directly out of your implementation.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're not conversant in C++, that might be difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very difficult. Though today I spoke to a couple of other researchers
</I>&gt;<i> in my group that said I may be able to learn C and then C++ in 40 to
</I>&gt;<i> 50 days (2-3 months). So I haven't given up hope with this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm not sure it would even take you that long, but maybe...

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Read your mesh into MOAB, and hand it to mesquite that way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This method is more complicated to begin with, but is a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> longer-term solution, esp. if you're wanting to get the mesh
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interacting with the geometry.  However, the picture you sent for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shuttle mesh looked like your points are already on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surface.  If that's true and you're ok with their location, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option is probably overkill.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where is your geometry coming from?  Iges, Step, CAD, facets?  I'm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in seeing if any of the tools I work on would help with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, this is where the root of some ideas are. I have two types of
</I>&gt;<i> applications in mind. The first is one where I have a surface
</I>&gt;<i> geometry specified by NURBS, probably IGES and possibly a CAD program
</I>&gt;<i> such as AML, and a topology for a grid. In this mode, I would want
</I>&gt;<i> MESQUITE to attach the topology to the geometry of the vehicle, where
</I>&gt;<i> I would specify which nodes attach to which set of surfaces. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, nodes that attach to the wall of the configuration and those
</I>&gt;<i> that attach to an outer flow domain surface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second application is one where I have spent the time generating
</I>&gt;<i> the wall grid of a vehicle, thereby defining the topology. I'd simply
</I>&gt;<i> then extend the block corners to an outer boundary defined by facets
</I>&gt;<i> (STL or triangular mesh). Then, let MESQUTIE move the nodes attached
</I>&gt;<i> to the outer boundary as needed to get an &quot;optimum&quot; mesh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'd be interested in talking to you about this.  The smoothing that 
mesquite provides is one piece of this, but there are others too 
(geometry, mesh, attaching &amp; relating the two).  The tools we've been 
developing as part of ITAPS (a DOE SciDAC project) would be pretty 
useful in this context.  Many are also directly callable from Fortran.

To get an idea of what I'm talking about, start from 
<A HREF="http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki.">http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki.</A>  You might've heard of CGM 
before, it's analogous to CAPRI.  MOAB is analogous, but for mesh data 
instead of geometry.
