<PRE>Jason,

   FORTRAN and pointers is not too difficult. The issue is what type of pointers is MESQUITE expecting. In FORTRAN 77, many of the compilers today offer Cray style pointers. In FORTRAN 90/95 the pointers are very different and do not interface correctly with C code. There is a function that provides the memory location of the pointer which I can then send as the pointer in memory from F90/95 to C which does work. So when discussing pointers and FORTRAN it is important to be specific.

   My issue with MESQUITE's callbacks is that in MeshInterface.hpp, there is mention of all types of callbacks that have to be built. Some address tags and others address iterators and get_all_vertices and get_all_elemenets, and other stuff. What is identified in the file suggests that I have to write C or C++ code that does all of this stuff. And if not, I have to write additional FORTRAN glue functions. So there appears to be a set of callbacks I have to program that are not entirely clear about what exactly I am to do and where exactly to get data, and where to place data on exit of the functions.

   I've written a lot of event driven software - GUIs for Tecplot with their addon development kit (ADK). In the ADK there are callbacks that are automatically generated to produce nothing when selected. So, if a callback is generated, then I know exactly where to put my own coding to begin building my own functionality. Additionally, the Tecplot ADK has nearly 500 functions that are available to get data, process it, and put it into Tecplot, all of which is well documented. In MESQUITE, I get the impression you expect me to know what functionality is needed and what needs to be done. I'm sorry, but I'm not clairvoyant. I have no idea what the callback functions in MeshInterface.hpp are supposed to be doing.

   As far as MESQUITE, I have version 1.1.7, which was downloaded from the MESQUITE website. Where would I find 2.0? Am I missing something with MESQUITE usage?

</I>&gt;<i> Not that I know of.  You will need implementations of the Mesh, Geom,
</I>&gt;<i> and Relation interfaces (e.g. MOAB, CGM, and Lasso).  If using Mesquite
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0, you shouldn't need Babel.  You will then need to get your data into these
</I>&gt;<i> tools.  To do that, you could use either intermediate file formats (probably
</I>&gt;<i> the only option for the geometry data) or direct API calls (might be
</I>&gt;<i> easiest for relating the mesh to the geometry.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far, I've been assuming that you will use such tools.  Another
</I>&gt;<i> option is to implement the subset of those APIs that are necessary for Mesquite
</I>&gt;<i> on top of your own code.  For this case, the you shouldn't need any additional
</I>&gt;<i> code other than Mesquite and your own.  From the point of view of
</I>&gt;<i> integrating with Mesquite, this is just another way to provide Mesquite with
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks to interrogate data.  The only difference is that you could implement
</I>&gt;<i> then in C rather than C++ (or perhaps even in Fortran*).

</I>&gt;<i> such as passing function arguments by value and working with pointers.
