<PRE>Announcing Mesquite 2.0.  A substantial re-design of much of the core
Mesquite code has been done over the last several years.  This is the first
official  release of the new core Mesquite implementation.  In addition to
the re-designed core code, this release includes the several new features
and many minor improvements listed below.


New Features and Improvements:
------------------------------

- Core code redesigned to support planned future improvements and
  to eliminate incompatibilities between various mesquite components.

- Conversion to GNU automake/libtool build system.
   - increases the number of supported platforms
   - option to compile as a shared library
   - &quot;make install&quot; and other standard make targets work correctly

- New solvers
   - TrustRegion
   - QuasiNewton

- Support for the latest ITAPS C APIs

- Most solvers support a new block coordinate descent optimization scheme.

- New ArrayMesh class allows Mesquite to operate directly on array-based
  application mesh data.  This will hopefully help to minimize the amount
  of glue code required to interface with FORTRAN code.

- Significant performance improvements for SteepestDescent solver.

- New mechanism to specify fixed vertices by dimension of associated
  geometric domain.

- Elimination of performance issues when using ITAPS APIs.

- API simplification
   - Many previous incompatible or nonsensical constructs now
     result in compile-time errors.
   - Many cases where the application had to request what should
     have been an obvious behavior have been removed.  For example:
      - analytical derivative calculations are now used whenever available
      - higher-order nodes are automatically adjusted to logical location
         as dictated by the default linear shape function for the element.

- Many minor improvements, bug fixes, etc.



Known Issues:
-------------

- Building using Microsoft Visual C++ is no longer supported.

- Beta &quot;Distance From Target&quot; metrics have been removed.



Additional Notes:
-----------------

- This information is included in the ANNOUNCE file within
  the source distribution.

- Information about updating applications for Mesquite API
  changes is included in the doc/Updating_From_1.x.txt file
  in the source distribution.
