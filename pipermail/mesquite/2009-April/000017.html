<PRE>Jason,

   The data I am attempting to smooth or optimize is the topology of a structured grid. In a structured grid, removing the grid from inside a block, you are left with a general hexahedral mesh of blocks. As shown in the attached figure, which has taken me quite some time to generate, is a hexahedral mesh of such a set of blocks that describes the topology of a space shuttle orbiter I have. The black lines are what I would expect to feed to MESQUITE, and the blue lines are what I would hope to retrieve. The blue lines are different in that they are more orthogonal to the surface of the orbiter, shaded in the image.

   The issue is that the grid I am using is in PLOT3D form, where each block is comprised of a 2x2x2 set of points representing the topological cube of a structured grid block. I have no idea what vtk is nor its format. But I am willing to write a FORTRAN code to read a PLOT3D file that formats the topological blocks into a set of hexahedral cells that I can send to MESQUITE. I just need to know the form of the data.

   The domain, or surface of the vehicle, is currently available as both a structured grid which can also be divided into an unstructured set of triangles, or IGES data consisting of NURBS. Again, I'm not sure I understand how to get this into MESQUITE.

   Thank you for the information thus far. I'm willing to do what is necessary to test MESUQITE in this process of smoothing a topology. So any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

</I>&gt;<i> Mesquite uses objects to represent components of an optimizer.  Things
</I>&gt;<i> such as:
</I>&gt;<i>   quality metric - evaluate the quality of the mesh at some local
</I>&gt;<i> feature
</I>&gt;<i>                    (e.g. quality of an element)
</I>&gt;<i>   objective function - define some global scalar value to optimize for
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>                        mesh (e.g. average of quality for each element)
</I>&gt;<i>   quality improver - improve mesh quality
</I>&gt;<i>   termination criterion - conditions upon which to terminate
</I>&gt;<i> optimization
</I>&gt;<i>   solver - subset of quality improvers that work by minimizing an
</I>&gt;<i> objective
</I>&gt;<i>            function
</I>&gt;<i>   quality assessor - print summary of one or more quality metrics
</I>&gt;<i> evaluated
</I>&gt;<i>                      over the mesh
</I>&gt;<i>   instruction queue - group top-level operations (solver, quality
</I>&gt;<i> assessor,
</I>&gt;<i>                       etc.) and provide API to initiate optimization
</I>&gt;<i>                       process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are many different implementations of each of these types or
</I>&gt;<i> classes
</I>&gt;<i> of objects.  Instances of implementations are assembled to construct an
</I>&gt;<i> optimizer.  There's an example of this in section 3.1.4 of the manual.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mesquite also provides two &quot;wrapper&quot; classes that take care of
</I>&gt;<i> assembling an
</I>&gt;<i> optimizer for the two most common use cases.  These are
</I>&gt;<i> ShapeImprovementWrapper and LaplacianIQ.  This is discussed briefly in
</I>&gt;<i> section 3.1.3 of the manual.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Creating an optimizer or using one of the wrappers is fairly
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward
</I>&gt;<i> given an minimal understanding of C++.  As you are not very familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> C++, I could probably put together a simple FORTRAN wrapper function
</I>&gt;<i> for you
</I>&gt;<i> if you were to describe exactly what you want for an optimizer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The more complex question is how to get your mesh data into Mesquite.
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> can be subdivided into two subsets: the mesh and the domain.  The mesh
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> the node locations, element connectivity, and the set of vertices that
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> fixed.  This is sufficient to set up an optimization when all the
</I>&gt;<i> boundary
</I>&gt;<i> vertices are fixed.  The domain is the geometry that some subset of the
</I>&gt;<i> nodes are constrained to lie on, and the association of specific nodes
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> specific subsets of the domain (e.g. with individual surfaces or curves
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> intersection of those surfaces.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The interface for accessing mesh in Mesquite is the Mesquite::Mesh
</I>&gt;<i> class,
</I>&gt;<i> which groups a set of call-back functions for querying characteristics
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the mesh and modifying vertex coordinates (and a few other details.)
</I>&gt;<i> In the
</I>&gt;<i> most general case one would provide implementations of all the
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks
</I>&gt;<i> that directly access some application data in a solver or mesh
</I>&gt;<i> generation
</I>&gt;<i> package.  For simpler cases Mesquite 1.1 provides the MeshImpl class,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> is an implementation of the callbacks that access data stored in a VTK
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0
</I>&gt;<i> file[1] (simple ASCII format for mesh.)  Mesquite 2.0 (will be released
</I>&gt;<i> today or tomorrow) will include the ArrayMesh class.  This class
</I>&gt;<i> implements
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks that access data in arrays provided by the application (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> array
</I>&gt;<i> of vertex coordinates, array of vertex indices defining elements, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> This class was added with the hope of simplifying this process for many
</I>&gt;<i> FORTRAN applications.  A third method of accessing mesh data is also
</I>&gt;<i> provided in Mesquite 2.0:  MsqIMesh.  This class acts as an adapter to
</I>&gt;<i> access mesh data through the iMesh[2] API.  These are discussed in
</I>&gt;<i> chapter 4
</I>&gt;<i> of the manual.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Mesquite::MeshDomain class defines the set of callbacks for
</I>&gt;<i> accessing
</I>&gt;<i> the geometric domain for the mesh.  While Mesquite does provide a few
</I>&gt;<i> trivial implementations, these certainly will not be sufficient to
</I>&gt;<i> represent
</I>&gt;<i> something like a portion of an aircraft.  So it will be necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> implement the callbacks for this, either by directly implementing those
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the MeshDomain class or by implementing the necessary subset
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the iGeom and iRel ITAPS interfaces[2] and using the MsqIGeom adapter.
