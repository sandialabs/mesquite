Subject: [Mesquite-announce] Mesquite Version 2.3.0 Release
Message-ID: <CDBABD3F.642E7%pknupp@sandia.gov>


Mesquite-2.3.0 is now available for download from the Mesquite Download Page.


Changes for 2.3.0:

  - Added polygon support to allow reading and writing of vtk files containing
    polygons and smoothing of meshes containing polygons using the Laplacian smoother.
  - Rewrote ShapeImprover wrapper determine if mesh to be optimized is
    tangled or not. If tangled, wrapper now uses a non-barrier metric and
    if not tangled, a barrier metric is used.
  - Created a new directory structure underneath meshFiles/3D/vtk and
    meshFiles/2D/vtk that arranges the mesh files into sub-directories
    based on element type and whether they are tangled or untangled.
  - Created new class MeshDomainAssoc to formally associate a Mesh instance
    with a Domain instance to verify that the mesh and domain are compatible.
  - Productionized the NonGradient solver.
  - Added new classes TMetricBarrier and TMetricNonBarrier to TMetric class to
    provide a clear division between the barrier and non-barrier target metric classes.
  - Added new classes AWMetricBarrier and AWMetricNonBarrier to AWMetric class
    for same reason as the TMetric classes.
  - Added a new error code "BARRIER_VIOLATED" to the MsgError class that is
    issued when a barrier violation is encountered when using a barrier target
    metric class.
  - Added warning when MaxTemplate is used with any solver other than NonGradient.
  - Made a number of changes to the Quality Summary output to improve
    readability and provide additional information.
